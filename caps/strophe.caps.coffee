    features = []
    features.push(k) for k in conn.disco._features

    # chek if there are identities
    if ids.length is 0 then ids.push dummyId

    ## Generate string

    # 1. Initialize an empty string S.

    S = ""

    # 2. Sort the service discovery identities by category and then by type and
    # then by xml:lang (if it exists), formatted as CATEGORY '/' [TYPE] '/' [LANG]
    # '/' [NAME]. Note that each slash is included even if the LANG or NAME is not
    # included (in accordance with XEP-0030, the category and type MUST be
    # included.

    propertySort( ids, "category" )
    propertySort( ids, "type" )
    propertySort( ids, "lang" )

    # 3. For each identity, append the 'category/type/lang/name' to S, followed by
    # the '<' character.

    for key, id of ids
      S += "#{id.category}/#{id.type}/#{id.lang}/#{id.name}<"

    # 4. Sort the supported service discovery features.

    features.sort()

    # 5. For each feature, append the feature to S, followed by the '<' character.

    for ns in features
      S += "#{ns}<"

    # 6. If the service discovery information response includes XEP-0128 data forms,
    # sort the forms by the FORM_TYPE (i.e., by the XML character data of the
    # <value/> element).

    # not implemented yet

    # 7. For each extended service discovery information form:

    #  a) Append the XML character data of the FORM_TYPE field's <value/> element,
    #     followed by the '<' character.

    # not implemented yet

    #  b) Sort the fields by the value of the "var" attribute.

    # not implemented yet

    #  c) For each field other than FORM_TYPE:

    #     i.  Append the value of the "var" attribute, followed by the '<'
    #         character.

    # not implemented yet

    #    ii.  Sort values by the XML character data of the <value/> element.

    # not implemented yet

    #   iii.  For each <value/> element, append the XML character data, followed by
    #         the '<' character.

    # not implemented yet

    # 8. Ensure that S is encoded according to the UTF-8 encoding.

    # not implemented yet

    # 9. Compute the verification string by hashing S using the algorithm
    # specified in the 'hash' attribute (e.g., SHA-1 as defined in RFC 3174 [19]).
    # The hashed data MUST be generated with binary output and encoded using
    # Base64 as specified in Section 4 of RFC 4648 [20] (note: the Base64 output
    # MUST NOT include whitespace and MUST set padding bits to zero).
